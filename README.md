# TrilobiteTermProjectF23
Trilobite Order Analysis - FALL 2023 Term Project

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH AND HYPOTHESES TO BE TESTED</h3>
In this research project, we will explore the world of trilobites. The goal of this project is to describe and construct a phylogenetic tree for the trilobite specimens studied, and their corresponding Orders. This will be accomplished based on the presence or absence of a list of observable morphological characteristics. An additional goal of this project is to track trilobites’ biodiversity overtime, from their beginnings in the Cambrian, to their end in the Permian. This will be done quantitatively using the list of characteristics mentioned above with an additive matrix distance method.
It is hypothesized that the trilobites’ biodiversity will decline over time starting by the end of the Ordovician period due to multiple mass extinction events and the rise of jawed fish.

<h3>SPECIFIC MUSEUM DATA REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS, WHERE THEY ARE LOCATE AND HOW TO GET ACCESS TO THEM:</h3>
To complete our research, we will be accessing the McGill Redpath Museum’s trilobite collection. We are currently coordinating with the Museum’s curator, Anthony Howell.
 
<h3>BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE METHODS YOU PLAN TO USE TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION:</h3>
Firstly, we will be defining a set of 10-20 relevant observable morphological characteristics. We will then record the absence (as a 0) or presence (as a 1) of such attributes for a given specimen. It is important for these characteristics to be chosen such that each can be determined to be either absent or present, without ambiguity, so that a corresponding additive distance matrix can be used. Then we will use phylogenetics to reconstruct a possible trilobite family tree and make quantitative statements about trilobite biodiversity through time.
